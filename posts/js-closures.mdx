In this example when we run the function we capture the `i` variable in closure and i will be incremented from 1 to 3.

<CodeBlock
  code={`let i: number = 0\n const closure = () => {\n ++i \n console.log(i)\n} \n closure() /*1*/ \n closure() /*2*/ \n closure() /*3*/ \n`}
  language="ts"
/>

But if we would define the i insdie the function we wouild not capture the closure because `i` would be a new value for every function execution.

<CodeBlock
  code={`const closure = (): void => {\n  let i = 0\n  ++i\n  console.log(i) \n} \n closure() /*1*/ \n closure() /*1*/ \n closure() /*1*/ \n`}
  language="ts"
/>
