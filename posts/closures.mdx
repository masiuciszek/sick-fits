> > Closure is something that access the value the that is not defined inside of it.

In this example when we run the function we capture the `i` variable in closure and i will be incremented from 1 to 3.

```ts
let i = 0

const closure = (): void => {
  ++i
  console.log(i)
}

closure() // 1
closure() // 2
closure() // 3
```

But if we would define the i insdie the function we wouild not capture the closure because `i` would be a new value for every function execution.

```ts
const closure = (): void => {
  let i = 0
  ++i
  console.log(i)
}

closure() // 1
closure() // 1
closure() // 1
```
